What we want to do
- switch between editor and play mode (like in unity and unreal)
- support collisions
- support arbitrary images as tiles
- a few items
- interaction with NPCs and players
- Path finding (A*): User should be able to move around tiles with arrow keys. If they pan the camera and click on the tile then move to that tile in the shortest amount of moves
- interactable tiles: if you are facing a certain tile and press an interact key and a message pops up
- UI to prompt user for information
